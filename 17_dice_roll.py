"""Exercise Description

Write a rollDice() function with a numberOfDice parameter that represents the number of six-sided dice. 
The function returns the sum of all of the dice rolls. For this exercise you must import Python’s random module to call its random.randint() 
function for this exercise.

These Python assert statements stop the program if their condition is False. 
Copy them to the bottom of your solution program. Your solution is correct if the following assert 
statements’ conditions are all True. We can’t predict rollDice()’s random return value, but we can do repeated checks 
that the return value is within the correct range of expected values:

assert rollDice(0) == 0

assert rollDice(1000) != rollDice(1000)

for i in range(1000):

    assert 1 <= rollDice(1) <= 6

    assert 2 <= rollDice(2) <= 12

    assert 3 <= rollDice(3) <= 18

    assert 100 <= rollDice(100) <= 600

There is an astronomically small chance that the assert rollDice(1000) != rollDice(1000) will fail with a false positive. 
This assertion tests that rollDice() doesn’t simply return the same “random” number each time by simulating rolling 1,000 dice 
twice and making sure the totals are different for both rolls. But, of course, 
there is a chance they’ll come up the same total and cause an AssertionError. In that case, 
just rerun the assertion tests. After all, what are the odds of that happening twice?

Try to write a solution based on the information in this description. If you still have trouble solving this exercise,
