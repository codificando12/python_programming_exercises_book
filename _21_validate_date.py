"""Exercise Description

Write an isValidDate() function with parameters year, month, and day. The function should return True 
if the integers provided for these parameters represent a valid date. Otherwise, the function returns False. 
Months are represented by the integers 1 (for January) to 12 (for December) and days are represented by integers 
1 up to 28, 29, 30, or 31 depending on the month and year. Your solution should import your leapyear.py program from 
Exercise #20 for its isLeapYear() function, as February 29th is a valid date on leap years.

September, April, June, and November have 30 days. The rest have 31, except February which has 28 days. On leap years, February has 29 days.

These Python assert statements stop the program if their condition is False. Copy them to the bottom of your solution program. 
Your solution is correct if the following assert statementsâ€™ conditions are all True:

assert isValidDate(1999, 12, 31) == True

assert isValidDate(2000, 2, 29) == True

assert isValidDate(2001, 2, 29) == False

assert isValidDate(2029, 13, 1) == False

assert isValidDate(1000000, 1, 1) == True

assert isValidDate(2015, 4, 31) == False

assert isValidDate(1970, 5, 99) == False

assert isValidDate(1981, 0, 3) == False

assert isValidDate(1666, 4, 0) == False

 

import datetime

d = datetime.date(1970, 1, 1)

oneDay = datetime.timedelta(days=1)

for i in range(1000000):

    assert isValidDate(d.year, d.month, d.day) == True

    d += oneDay
