"""Exercise Description

Write a printASCIITable() function that displays the ASCII number and its corresponding text character, from 32 to 126. (These are called the printable ASCII characters.)

Your solution is correct if calling printASCIITable() displays output that looks like the following:

32 

33 !

34 "

35 #

--more--

124 |

125 }

126 ~

Note that the character for ASCII value 32 is the space character, which is why it looks like nothing is next to 32 in the output.

Try to write a solution based on the information in this description. If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the Solution Design and Special Cases and Gotchas sections for additional hints.

Prerequisite concepts: for loops, range() with two arguments, chr()"""

def printASCIITable(num):

    for i in range(32, num):
        print(i, chr(i))
