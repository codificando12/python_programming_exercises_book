"""Write a function named collatz() with a startingNumber parameter. '
The function returns a list of integers of the Collatz sequence that startingNumber produces. 
The first integer in this list must be startingNumber and the last integer must be 1.

Your function should check if startingNumber is an integer less than 1, and in that case, return an empty list.

These Python assert statements stop the program if their condition is False. 
Copy them to the bottom of your solution program. Your solution is correct if the following assert statementsâ€™ conditions are all True:"""
