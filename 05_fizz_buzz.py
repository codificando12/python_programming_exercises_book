"""Exercise Description

Write a fizzBuzz() function with a single integer parameter named upTo. For the numbers 1 up to and including upTo, the function prints one of four things:

·       Prints 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.

·       Prints 'Fizz' if the number is only divisible by 3.

·       Prints 'Buzz' if the number is only divisible by 5.

·       Prints the number if the number is neither divisible by 3 nor 5.

Instead of printing each string or number on a separate line, print them without newlines. 
For example, your solution is correct if calling fizzBuzz(35) produces the following output:

1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz

Try to write a solution based on the information in this description. If you still have trouble solving this exercise,
